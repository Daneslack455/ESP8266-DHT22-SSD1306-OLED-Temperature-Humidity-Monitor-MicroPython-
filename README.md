## 📖 Overview

This project reads **temperature** and **humidity** data from a **DHT22 sensor** and displays it on a **128x64 SSD1306 OLED display** using **MicroPython** on an **ESP8266** board. It offers a simple and effective way to monitor environmental conditions. This setup is ideal for IoT dashboards and smart home systems.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps. You will need:

- An **ESP8266** microcontroller board.
- A **DHT22** temperature and humidity sensor.
- A **128x64 SSD1306 OLED display**.
- Basic connectivity components (like jumper wires).
- A Wi-Fi connection to deploy your setup.

## 🔌 Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Wi-Fi connection**: For wireless monitoring
- **MicroPython firmware**: Installed on your ESP8266
- **Thonny IDE**: Recommended for easy programming of your MicroPython board

### 5. Connect Your ESP8266

1. Connect your **ESP8266** to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Make sure the drivers for the board are properly installed. If not, download them from the manufacturer's website.

### 6. Open Thonny IDE

1. Start the Thonny IDE on your computer.
2. Go to “Tools” in the menu, then "Options."
3. In the "Interpreter" section, select "MicroPython (ESP8266)" and choose the correct COM port for your ESP8266.

### 7. Upload Files to ESP8266

1. Open the directory where you extracted the files.
2. In Thonny IDE, go to “File,” then “Upload to” and select your ESP8266.
3. Upload all the necessary files one by one. These files typically include the main script and library files.

### 8. Configure Your Settings

Before running the software, you may need to edit the settings in the main script. 

1. In Thonny, open the main script file.
2. Find the section where you input your Wi-Fi credentials.
3. Enter your **SSID** (network name) and **password**.

### 9. Run the Program

1. Make sure your DHT22 sensor and SSD1306 display are hooked up correctly to the ESP8266.
2. In Thonny, click the green "Run" button to start the program.
3. Monitor the output in the Thonny shell. You should see temperature and humidity readings displayed in the console.

### 10. View Data on the OLED Display

Once your program is running, you should see temperature and humidity readings displayed on your OLED screen. Adjust the placement of your sensor and display as needed for optimal readings.

## 📊 Features
